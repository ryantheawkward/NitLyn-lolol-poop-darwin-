            <p>Nitlyn is a lossless compression application that allows its user to compress files without changes in quality of pictures or videos using their lossless compression alogrithm. Nitlyn is a multi platform based on computer only (for the time being). NitLyn's FC allows its users send files directly to Discord, because of Discords 8.00mb Limit. No Need For Nitro!</p>

            <legend><b>NitLyn's History</b></legend>
        <p>Nitlyn started out as a video streaming service however it changed its business model to lossless compression after many problems with bandwidth. It was started back in February 9th, 2020 with the name “Dateify” it was later changed to “Nitlyn” after the domain was already registered, the first design was made in a french class by 2 friends Julian Pitterson the C.E.O, and James Allen Batara the C.T.O. 5 people were asked to join Nitlyn, one declined however the other 4 accepted, 2 of those people were Ryan George and Darwin Garcia, (the developers). The other 2 people were fired due to lack of contribution and not enough dedication.</p>
